aljebra -- 
binary search on bits ---- 
process to directly take out the ans --- 
is all the cases possible or the first 3 4 values are only possible(remainder questions)---- mistake have been made here(note)
dp---- 
dp to direcly take tout the ans--- 
making a part constat and then dp on remaining part---
putting values (1 0 2) then finding the ans--- 
factors -- 
prime factors-
prefix sum to directly get the ans --- 
two pointer sliding windows --- 
when ever thinging is complex try to refresh it in a more simple way-- 
sort----
(+1 -1 trick along with prefix sum)----
write all possibilities--- 
two pinter--
sliding window--- 
modolulo divide logic(gcd logic)
do brute force code to see pattern
